# kinect-facetracking

Kinect-facetracking is an in-process node module which exposes the face-tracking datastream from the Kinect 2.0. Check out the wiki for a detailed write-up, helpful links, and questions I found myself asking--and answering--along the way.

The library attempts to expand [kinect2](https://github.com/wouterverweirder/kinect2), a Nodejs library to access the kinect 2 data via the MS SDK by Wouter ver Weirder.
